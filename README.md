# Unix-based Shell - bwsh

This project is a Unix-based shell that mimics similar functionality to that of larger shells such as zsh and bash, although it's much smaller.

## Getting Started
All that is needed to get started is to make sure that you have a C compiler on your machine, such as gcc, and CMake. Then, clone this repository to your machine, run CMake in the same
directory, and run the executable.

## Built-in Commands
* cd
* ls
* pwd
* alias
* history
* clear
* touch

Even though this project was originally created for one of my computer science classes, I am going to continue to work on it, refine it, and add more features to make it an 
impressive and robust shell.
